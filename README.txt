For this to work, you will need the following installed...

Python.
Scapy.
Dsniff Suite.
DriftNet.
Tshark (part of Wireshark).
SSLStrip.
And probably some other crap I forgot to document.

If there are bugs, make an issue about it on the code page, I will fix it :)

TODO:
Add a "proxy" for web traffic so we can inject iFrames and shit
Replace arpspoof with native SCAPY code
Fix some minor bugs with stopping attacks
Add more traffic dissection utils
Integrate SSH MiTM tools!
